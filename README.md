# Violet YarKhan  
**Prospective Engineering / Computer Science Student**

I am a student engineer interested in robotics, academic computing, and applied algorithms. My work is mostly in competitive robotics, AI systems, and computational research, where I use mathematical modeling and high-performance computing to study real-world systems.

This portfolio highlights my recent projects where I used my computation and engineering skills under pressure, whether it be time pressure, or issues of scale, and afterwards I reflected on how the systems in those fields can be improved.
