## Context
- Oak Ridge National Laboratory  
- 5 Weeks in Summer 2024  
- Team: Two interns, supervised by research scientists  
- Role: Model development, simulation, analysis

This project focused on modeling the spread of infectious diseases using both differential-equation based and stochastic approaches to inform public health decision-making.

## Technical Challenges:
- Epidemics are inherently complex systems with nonlinear dynamics and a level of uncertainty.
- Accurately modeling them requires balancing realism with computational efficiency and clearly communicating assumptions.

## My Contributions
- Implemented SIR-based differential equation models to simulate disease spread  
- Built stochastic simulations model simple dynamics  
- Compared four policy scenarios across different populations  
- Analyzed the short and long-term impacts of social distancing and vaccination strategies  

## Tools & Methods
- Python  
- Partial differential equations (SIR models)  
- Euler’s method for numerical simulation  
- Data visualization with matplotlib

## Results
- Social distancing produced the strongest short-term reduction in infections  
- Vaccination supported long-term immunity
- A combined strategy was the most effective at controlling an epidemic  
- Demonstrated how computational models can inform real-world policy decisions

## Reflection
This project showed me how mathematical models can directly influence policymakers. I learned to evaluate model assumptions, understand the limitations of numerical methods, and communicate results in a way that is meaningful to a variety of audiences.
