## Context
- Team 3966, FIRST Robotics Competition  
- Season: 2025  
- Team size: ~50  
- Role: Primary driver, lead programmer, systems integrator

## Technical Challenges:
- Developing control systems that could handle dynamic competition conditions while coordinating with a larger software team. 
- The robot required precise timing, rapid decision-making, and modular programming to adapt to different game challenges.

## My Contributions
- Implemented core robot control logic, including shooter and turret system simulations for future team use 
- Performed 150+ Git commits to refine and optimize code over the season  
- Acted as primary driver, making split-second decisions that guided the team to Regional Finals 

## Tools & Methods
- Java & WPILib for robot programming  
- Git version control  
- PID control systems and real-time feedback loops

## Results
- Helped improve team ranking from bottom 25% worldwide to top 16% in a single season
- As junior, programmed & drove robot for team to be Alliance Captain at Rocket City Regional (2025) & Smoky Mountains Regional (2025), going to a finals tiebreaker to qualify for the world championships at Smoky Mountain Regional
- Created modular template code for future robots to facilitate team onboarding

## Reflection
This experience taught me the importance of integrating software and hardware under real-world constraints. Driving the robot informed how I approached programming decisions, highlighting the connection between human factors and control system design.
